    The conversation between the doctor and the patient, Michelle, revolves around Michelle's symptoms of fatigue, yellow skin and eyes, and potential liver disease. Here are the key points from the conversation:

1. **Symptoms**: Michelle has been experiencing fatigue for the past two weeks, and her skin and eyes have turned yellow. She has not noticed any improvement in her fatigue even after resting.

2. **Duration and progression**: The yellowing of her skin and eyes has been constant, and she was first noticed by others. She has not had any fever, cough, vomiting, chest pain, or abdominal pain.

3. **Weight and appetite**: Michelle has experienced weight loss and a decrease in appetite.

4. **Medical history**: Michelle has no history of hypertension, epilepsy, asthma, diabetes, sickle cell disease, or peptic ulcer disease. She has never had any surgeries or blood transfusions.

6. **Lifestyle habits**: Michelle drinks 5-6 beers every day for 20 years, but she does not smoke.

[Speaker 1]: Ok. Mr musa. What brings you here today?

00:33:24
[Speaker 2]: Ok. Doctor i have been experiencing rectal bleeding for the past two weeks and it is gotten worse. Starting off as a little bit of blood in my stool but now there's quite alot of bright red blood mixed in. I have also had change of this in my bowel cavity, going from regular to alternating between my constipation and diarrhea and i have lost some weight unintentionally and i have been feeling really tired lately 

01:09:56
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Giving these symptoms. Can i? I want to start by asking you a few more questions to understand your condition better. First is have you notice any blood on the toilet paper or in the toilet room?

01:35:31
[Speaker 2]: Yes. I definitely notice blood on the toilet paper. Sometimes there's even blood dripping into the toilet after i finished going into the bathroom 

01:50:16
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That a significant amount of bleeding. So i want to investigate on this further. So i want to ask you about your diet. Have you notice any changes in your appetite or the food you're eating? 

02:08:54
[Speaker 2]: To be honest, my appetite has been i little bit up lately. I have been feeling an unusual. I have been having to force myself to eat sometimes. I haven't really made a big changes to my diet though

02:26:43
[Speaker 1]: Ok. So Thank you for sharing this information. I have a few more questions to ask about your medical history and family history and all. First can you tell me about your past medical history including any surgeries or hospitalizations?

02:54:28
[Speaker 2]: I haven't really had any major surgeries or hospitalizations in the past. I have high blood pressure but it is well controlled with medication 

03:07:00
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That's good to hear. And regarding your family history can you tell me about your family history either your mom or your dad?

03:27:51
[Speaker 2]: Regarding my family. My father passed away from colorectal cancer 

03:35:44
[Speaker 1]: Ok

03:37:45
[Speaker 2]: That's about it and my mother has breast cancer about 10 years ago but she's been in remission for several years now. I think other than that I can't think of any other illness or cancers that run in my family 

03:57:05
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. So a family history of cancer especially colorectal cancer and breast cancer can increase your risk for developing certain cancers. But now let's talk about your social history. Do you drink or smoke?

04:29:21
[Speaker 2]: I don't smoke and i quit about 10 years ago but i do drink on occasional events 

04:39:46
[Speaker 1]: That's great. Quiting smoking can be significantly reduce your of developing several types of cancer. Now let's move on to allergies. Do you have known allergies either to medications or other substance?

05:03:12
[Speaker 2]: No. I don't have any known allergies. I have never had any issues with medication or anything else like that 

05:11:36
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. Now based on your symptoms and family history and social history there are few possible conditions that could be causing these symptoms. One possibility as you mentioned is colorectal cancer and other possibility include  inflammatory bowel disease, polyps or hemorrhoids and diverticulosis. To confirm all these conditions i would like to have some test including colonoscopy and blood test 

05:54:28
[Speaker 2]: A colonoscopy sounds a bit intimidating. Can you tell me more about what it involves? And what you expect to find? 

06:07:08
[Speaker 1]: I understand your concern and i may know a colonoscopy is a procedure where a flexible tube and a camera is inserted through the rectum and into the colon. You know, to examine of the large intestine. So it is very common and safe procedure that is used to screen for and diagnosed for colon and rectum condition. So i expect to find the cause of your symptoms whether it is cancer, polyps or something else. So you see during the colonoscopy if we find any polyps or areas of concern, we can remove small samples of the tissue for further examination. This is known as biopsy. We can also take biopsies of any abnormal looking areas in the colon lining. So to sample will then be sent to a lab for analysis to determine if they are cancerous or benign 

07:17:56
[Speaker 2]: What will happen if biopsy result shows that i have cancer doctor?

07:25:41
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Excuse me, if the biopsy results comes back as positive for cancer then we will discuss the best treatment options for you 

07:42:04
[Speaker 2]: Thank you for answering all my questions doctor. I feel a bit more informed now but also more nervous about the possibility of a cancer

07:53:31
[Speaker 1]: I understand how you feel but remember that catching any potential issues early can make a big difference. I am here to support you through this process and i will schedule the test and i will take one step at a time. So please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or concerns 

08:18:44
[Speaker 2]: Thank you. I will be waiting for the test result and i appreciate your help 

08:24:15
[Speaker 1]: You are very much welcome. 

So based on my findings from the symptoms you shared and the information shared from the patient. There's rectal bleeding for two weeks worsening over time and change in bowel habit. There's no significant past medical history, Family history and there's also family history of colorectal and breast cancer. There's no current smoking but occasional alcohol consumption and there are no allergies. So the possible diagnosis includes colorectal cancer which is the most likely based on the symptom, family history and also social history and also the second diagnosis could be inflammatory bowel disease which is known as the IBD which is less likely due to lack of abdominal pain or diarrhea.""

00:23:59
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Mr musa. What brings you here today?

00:33:24
[Speaker 2]: Ok. Doctor i have been experiencing rectal bleeding for the past two weeks and it is gotten worse. Starting off as a little bit of blood in my stool but now there's quite alot of bright red blood mixed in. I have also had change of this in my bowel cavity, going from regular to alternating between my constipation and diarrhea and i have lost some weight unintentionally and i have been feeling really tired lately 

01:09:56
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Giving these symptoms. Can i? I want to start by asking you a few more questions to understand your condition better. First is have you notice any blood on the toilet paper or in the toilet room?

01:35:31
[Speaker 2]: Yes. I definitely notice blood on the toilet paper. Sometimes there's even blood dripping into the toilet after i finished going into the bathroom 

01:50:16
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That a significant amount of bleeding. So i want to investigate on this further. So i want to ask you about your diet. Have you notice any changes in your appetite or the food you're eating? 

02:08:54
[Speaker 2]: To be honest, my appetite has been i little bit up lately. I have been feeling an unusual. I have been having to force myself to eat sometimes. I haven't really made a big changes to my diet though

02:26:43
[Speaker 1]: Ok. So Thank you for sharing this information. I have a few more questions to ask about your medical history and family history and all. First can you tell me about your past medical history including any surgeries or hospitalizations?

02:54:28
[Speaker 2]: I haven't really had any major surgeries or hospitalizations in the past. I have high blood pressure but it is well controlled with medication 

03:07:00
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That's good to hear. And regarding your family history can you tell me about your family history either your mom or your dad?

03:27:51
[Speaker 2]: Regarding my family. My father passed away from colorectal cancer 

03:35:44
[Speaker 1]: Ok

03:37:45
[Speaker 2]: That's about it and my mother has breast cancer about 10 years ago but she's been in remission for several years now. I think other than that I can't think of any other illness or cancers that run in my family 

03:57:05
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. So a family history of cancer especially colorectal cancer and breast cancer can increase your risk for developing certain cancers. But now let's talk about your social history. Do you drink or smoke?

04:29:21
[Speaker 2]: I don't smoke and i quit about 10 years ago but i do drink on occasional events 

04:39:46
[Speaker 1]: That's great. Quiting smoking can be significantly reduce your of developing several types of cancer. Now let's move on to allergies. Do you have known allergies either to medications or other substance?

05:03:12
[Speaker 2]: No. I don't have any known allergies. I have never had any issues with medication or anything else like that 

05:11:36
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. Now based on your symptoms and family history and social history there are few possible conditions that could be causing these symptoms. One possibility as you mentioned is colorectal cancer and other possibility include  inflammatory bowel disease, polyps or hemorrhoids and diverticulosis. To confirm all these conditions i would like to have some test including colonoscopy and blood test 

05:54:28
[Speaker 2]: A colonoscopy sounds a bit intimidating. Can you tell me more about what it involves? And what you expect to find? 

06:07:08
[Speaker 1]: I understand your concern and i may know a colonoscopy is a procedure where a flexible tube and a camera is inserted through the rectum and into the colon. You know, to examine of the large intestine. So it is very common and safe procedure that is used to screen for and diagnosed for colon and rectum condition. So i expect to find the cause of your symptoms whether it is cancer, polyps or something else. So you see during the colonoscopy if we find any polyps or areas of concern, we can remove small samples of the tissue for further examination. This is known as biopsy. We can also take biopsies of any abnormal looking areas in the colon lining. So to sample will then be sent to a lab for analysis to determine if they are cancerous or benign 

07:17:56
[Speaker 2]: What will happen if biopsy result shows that i have cancer doctor?

07:25:41
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Excuse me, if the biopsy results comes back as positive for cancer then we will discuss the best treatment options for you 

07:42:04
[Speaker 2]: Thank you for answering all my questions doctor. I feel a bit more informed now but also more nervous about the possibility of a cancer

07:53:31
[Speaker 1]: I understand how you feel but remember that catching any potential issues early can make a big difference. I am here to support you through this process and i will schedule the test and i will take one step at a time. So please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or concerns 

08:18:44
[Speaker 2]: Thank you. I will be waiting for the test result and i appreciate your help 

08:24:15
[Speaker 1]: You are very much welcome. 

So based on my findings from the symptoms you shared and the information shared from the patient. There's rectal bleeding for two weeks worsening over time and change in bowel habit. There's no significant past medical history, Family history and there's also family history of colorectal and breast cancer. There's no current smoking but occasional alcohol consumption and there are no allergies. So the possible diagnosis includes colorectal cancer which is the most likely based on the symptom, family history and also social history and also the second diagnosis could be inflammatory bowel disease which is known as the IBD which is less likely due to lack of abdominal pain or diarrhea.""

The patient, a 45 year old female complains of frequent urination and excessive thirst which has lasted for 2 weeks, and this frequent urination occurs mostly at night. And the patient complains, says there is no burning sensation or associated pain during urination. My diagnosis is, I suspect the patient has diabetes mellitus specifically type 2 diabetes. The symptoms of frequent urination, excessive thirst, fatigue and unintentional weight loss are classic signs of diabetes. For further diagnosis, I will request a fasting plasma glucose test and a oral glucose tolerance test.

03:39:18","Based on the provided transcript, here are the key points from the conversation between Dr. Brown and Chike:

**Patient Information**

- The patient's name is Chike, a 35-year-old male.
- He is a resident who lives alone and prepares his food himself.
- He does not smoke, drink alcohol regularly, or take recreational drugs.
- He has no known drug allergies.
- He has no previous history of similar diarrhea issues or chronic diseases.
- He has not had any past surgeries or hospital admissions.
- He does not patronize food vendors outside.

**Chief Complaint**

- Chike has been experiencing loose stool for over two days, with up to ten episodes.
- The onset was sudden.
- The stool is not bloody or contains pus.
- He has a fever that is high-grade and constant throughout the day.
- The fever has been present for one day.
- He does not have abdominal pain or vomiting.

**Additional Information**

- Chike had a recent travel to a rural area within the past week.
- He washes his hands before preparing food.
- He uses tap water for drinking and cooking.
- He does not have a family history of similar illnesses.
- He occasionally takes alcohol.

**Assessment**

Based on the information provided, it appears that Chike is experiencing a gastrointestinal infection. The sudden onset of loose stool, fever, and high-grade fever suggest a possible viral or bacterial infection. The absence of abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody or purulent stool makes a severe gastrointestinal infection less likely. Further investigation, such as stool culture or PCR, may be necessary to determine the cause of Chike's symptoms.","The patient, Chike, is a 35-year-old male presenting with a sudden onset of frequent loose stools for the past two days, with approximately ten episodes reported. The diarrhea is non-bloody and contains no pus. He also reports a constant, high-grade fever that started one day ago, but denies any abdominal pain or vomiting. There have been no recent changes in diet or water source, and he has not had contact with anyone with a similar illness. Chike recently traveled to a rural area within the past week and has no prior history of similar diarrhea or chronic illnesses. He prepares his own food, maintains proper hygiene, and does not patronize food vendors. He lives alone, has no family history of similar illness, and reports no known drug allergies, past surgeries, or hospital admissions. He occasionally drinks alcohol but does not smoke or use recreational drugs. His drinking and cooking water comes from a tap.","

    Summary:
    Based on the provided transcript, here are the key points from the conversation between Dr. Brown and Chike:

**Patient Information**

- He is a resident who lives alone and prepares his food himself.
- He does not smoke, drink alcohol regularly, or take recreational drugs.
- He has no known drug allergies.
- He has no previous history of similar diarrhea issues or chronic diseases.
- He has not had any past surgeries or hospital admissions.
- He does not patronize food vendors outside.

**Chief Complaint**

- Chike has been experiencing loose stool for over two days, with up to ten episodes.
- The onset was sudden.
- The stool is not bloody or contains pus.
- He has a fever that is high-grade and constant throughout the day.
- The fever has been present for one day.
- He does not have abdominal pain or vomiting.

**Additional Information**

- Chike had a recent travel to a rural area within the past week.
- He washes his hands before preparing food.
- He uses tap water for drinking and cooking.

- He occasionally takes alcohol.

**Assessment**

Based on the information provided, it appears that Chike is experiencing a gastrointestinal infection. The sudden onset of loose stool, fever, and high-grade fever suggest a possible viral or bacterial infection. The absence of abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody or purulent stool makes a severe gastrointestinal infection less likely. Further investigation, such as stool culture or PCR, may be necessary to determine the cause of Chike's symptoms.
