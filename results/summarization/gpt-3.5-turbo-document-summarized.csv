[Speaker 2]: Hi, I am Ositadinma, I am 55 year old.
00:15:20

00:17:43
[Speaker 1]: So, What brought you here today?
00:20:07

00:22:15
[Speaker 2]: Doctor, I have been having shortness of breath, and I have been feeling fatigue for the past two weeks. The pain is just so much; you know how bad it is when you are struggling with your breath. Then another thing is fatigue. The fatigue  is just constant, it never goes, it doesn't want to go.
00:48:00


00:50:07
[Speaker 1]: Okay, So can you tell me more about it?
00:52:47

00:53:02
[Speaker 2]: When it starts, it feels as if I am, I am looking for my breath, as in, as in I am gasping for my breath, like something is choking me, as if I am going to die the next minute and it actually started small gradually.
01:13:15

01:14:26
[Speaker 1]: Okay. I will be asking you few more questions about that. You said shortness of breath started gradually. Can you explain on the fatigue, Is there any thing you do that makes it worse?
01:27:23

01:28:04
[Speaker 2]: Yes Doctor. The fatigue is just constant. It doesn't go at all and it doesn't matter what I do, it will still be there and it doesn't even have any time that it use to come. I always feel the same way morning, afternoon and night. The thing is just there.
01:51:41

01:54:08
[Speaker 1]: Okay, Is there any other symptoms you get, like chest pain, palpitation, dizziness, or fainting?
01:59:25

[Speaker 1]: Okay, When the cough comes, How long does it last? Does it come during the day or at night? At what time does it normally come?
02:17:49

02:19:27
[Speaker 2]: The truth is that the cough comes, it comes on its own, but mostly, it used to come at night. It used to disturb me well at night.
02:32:23

02:34:11
[Speaker 1]: Okay, Is there any other thing that makes the shortness of breath worse? Like standing up, lying flat, exertion? Do you feel relieved by any of those things?
02:45:04

02:46:56
[Speaker 2]: Yes, yes it's worse on exertion and even when I'm lying flat. But, but whenever I shift like this and sit down, sit up, I will feel better. The thing will no longer be disturbing me that much again. So I think its better when I'm sitting up.
03:10:33

03:12:02
[Speaker 1]: Okay, on a scale of 1-10, Can you describe how bad it is?

[Speaker 2]: No, I haven't had any pelvic pain.

05:14:01
[Speaker 1]: Okay, so thank you Kemi. Based on your responses, your gynaecological health seems to be normal. now lets continue with the examination of your leg. so based on your on our discussion, i'll like to perform a physical examination to better understand what might be causing your symptoms. we'll start by examining your leg, your left leg and checking your temperature.

05:46:58
[Speaker 2]: Okay, Doctor

05:49:47
[Speaker 1]: Okay, so based on your symptoms and examination,it's possible that you have a condition called deep vein thrombosis, which is a blood clot in one of the deep veins in your leg. This can cause pain, swelling and fever especially if the clot breaks loose and travels to your lungs causing a pulmonary embolism. However, we will need to confirm this with some tests, such as an ultrasound of your leg, and we will also check for any signs of infection, such as cellulitis. In the meantime, we are going to prescribe some drugs, some medication to help with the pain and the swelling. so, that's what we're gonna do for now.

06:43:27
[Speaker 2]: Okay sir. thank you, doctor,

06:45:02
[Speaker 1]: okay, so is there anything else you'll like to discuss?

06:48:53
[Speaker 2]: No, Doctor. Thank you for your help.

06:51:22
[Speaker 1]: you are welcome, Kemi. we'll get to the bottom of this together and make sure you are feeling better soon. take care.

01:35:31
[Speaker 2]: Yes. I definitely notice blood on the toilet paper. Sometimes there's even blood dripping into the toilet after i finished going into the bathroom 

01:50:16
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That a significant amount of bleeding. So i want to investigate on this further. So i want to ask you about your diet. Have you notice any changes in your appetite or the food you're eating? 

02:08:54
[Speaker 2]: To be honest, my appetite has been i little bit up lately. I have been feeling an unusual. I have been having to force myself to eat sometimes. I haven't really made a big changes to my diet though

02:26:43
[Speaker 1]: Ok. So Thank you for sharing this information. I have a few more questions to ask about your medical history and family history and all. First can you tell me about your past medical history including any surgeries or hospitalizations?

02:54:28
[Speaker 2]: I haven't really had any major surgeries or hospitalizations in the past. I have high blood pressure but it is well controlled with medication 

03:07:00
[Speaker 1]: Ok. That's good to hear. And regarding your family history can you tell me about your family history either your mom or your dad?

03:27:51
[Speaker 2]: Regarding my family. My father passed away from colorectal cancer 

03:35:44
[Speaker 1]: Ok

03:37:45
[Speaker 2]: That's about it and my mother has breast cancer about 10 years ago but she's been in remission for several years now. I think other than that I can't think of any other illness or cancers that run in my family 

03:57:05
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. So a family history of cancer especially colorectal cancer and breast cancer can increase your risk for developing certain cancers. But now let's talk about your social history. Do you drink or smoke?

04:29:21
[Speaker 2]: I don't smoke and i quit about 10 years ago but i do drink on occasional events 

04:39:46
[Speaker 1]: That's great. Quiting smoking can be significantly reduce your of developing several types of cancer. Now let's move on to allergies. Do you have known allergies either to medications or other substance?

05:03:12
[Speaker 2]: No. I don't have any known allergies. I have never had any issues with medication or anything else like that 

05:11:36
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Thank you for sharing that information. Now based on your symptoms and family history and social history there are few possible conditions that could be causing these symptoms. One possibility as you mentioned is colorectal cancer and other possibility include  inflammatory bowel disease, polyps or hemorrhoids and diverticulosis. To confirm all these conditions i would like to have some test including colonoscopy and blood test 

05:54:28
[Speaker 2]: A colonoscopy sounds a bit intimidating. Can you tell me more about what it involves? And what you expect to find? 

06:07:08
[Speaker 1]: I understand your concern and i may know a colonoscopy is a procedure where a flexible tube and a camera is inserted through the rectum and into the colon. You know, to examine of the large intestine. So it is very common and safe procedure that is used to screen for and diagnosed for colon and rectum condition. So i expect to find the cause of your symptoms whether it is cancer, polyps or something else. So you see during the colonoscopy if we find any polyps or areas of concern, we can remove small samples of the tissue for further examination. This is known as biopsy. We can also take biopsies of any abnormal looking areas in the colon lining. So to sample will then be sent to a lab for analysis to determine if they are cancerous or benign 

07:17:56
[Speaker 2]: What will happen if biopsy result shows that i have cancer doctor?

07:25:41
[Speaker 1]: Ok. Excuse me, if the biopsy results comes back as positive for cancer then we will discuss the best treatment options for you 

07:42:04
[Speaker 2]: Thank you for answering all my questions doctor. I feel a bit more informed now but also more nervous about the possibility of a cancer

07:53:31
[Speaker 1]: I understand how you feel but remember that catching any potential issues early can make a big difference. I am here to support you through this process and i will schedule the test and i will take one step at a time. So please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or concerns 

08:18:44
[Speaker 2]: Thank you. I will be waiting for the test result and i appreciate your help 

08:24:15
[Speaker 1]: You are very much welcome.

There's no significant past medical history, Family history and there's also family history of colorectal and breast cancer. There's no current smoking but occasional alcohol consumption and there are no allergies.

07:24:59","The conversation is between a doctor (Speaker 1) and a patient (Gift, Speaker 2) who presents with fever for two days. The patient describes having a sudden onset of high-grade fever, associated with chills and profuse sweating, along with other symptoms like headaches, body weakness, loss of appetite, and nausea. The patient tried self-management with cold water and paracetamol but did not find relief. There is no history of other medical conditions or recent travel.

The doctor suspects malaria due to the patient living in a malaria-endemic area and not using mosquito preventive measures. The doctor plans to conduct further examinations and investigations to confirm the diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment. The patient denies other family members experiencing similar symptoms.","

I want to do a general examination and then I want to examine parts of your body and then afterwards I would like to run some investigation. I am really suspecting that you might be having some form of malaria since you stay in a malaria endemic area and you do not sleep under mosquito net or insect repellent. In your family do you have anyone with this same problems? Your children or your husband, is there anyone with this form of, with a similar problem as this?

Alright thank you very much for you responses. 
Alright. Thank you

    Summary:
    The conversation is between a doctor (Speaker 1) and a patient (Gift, Speaker 2) who presents with fever for two days. The patient describes having a sudden onset of high-grade fever, associated with chills and profuse sweating, along with other symptoms like headaches, body weakness, loss of appetite, and nausea. The patient tried self-management with cold water and paracetamol but did not find relief. There is no history of other medical conditions or recent travel.

The doctor suspects malaria due to the patient living in a malaria-endemic area and not using mosquito preventive measures. The doctor plans to conduct further examinations and investigations to confirm the diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment. The patient denies other family members experiencing similar symptoms.
